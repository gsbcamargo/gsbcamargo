### My name is **Gabriel Schreiner** 
### and I'm a lifelong learner, currently working as a Fullstack Developer (using Java and Angular). 
I used to work as a lawyer before that.

#### My personal interests in the tech field are Software Engineering, Programming Languages and their paradigms!
At the moment I'm diving into Functional Programming with Elixir (and being slightly beaten by it).
