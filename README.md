### My name is **Gabriel Schreiner** 

### and I'm a lifelong learner, currently working mostly with Java. 
I used to work as a lawyer before that.

#### My personal interests in the tech field are Software Engineering, Programming Languages and their paradigms!
At the moment I'm diving into Functional Programming with Elixir and I'm also learning Rust.

In my free time I like reading (not necessarily technical stuff). I love medieval fantasy!
